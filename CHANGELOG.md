### Information
 - Winion is completely open source: the GitHub repository is public, with the full source code accessible via git clone, under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. I must clarify this, as it is due to the fact that the documentation is outdated and may have caused some confusion.

### Added
- Linux support is finally available!
Winion can now run on distributions based on the Linux kernel (successfully tested on Ubuntu).
This version is still undergoing optimization and stabilization before being ready for production use.
⚠️ The package system remains partially incompatible, as it was originally designed for Windows.
Only packages written entirely in pure Python are currently supported.
